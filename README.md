## Introduction

This is a simple command-line interface (CLI) application designed to help you manage your daily tasks. This Python script allows you to add, list, and delete tasks, providing a straightforward way to keep track of your to-dos. It uses a JSON file for persistent storage, making it easy to keep your tasks organized.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Add new tasks with a name and due date.
- **List Tasks**: View all your tasks with their due dates.
- **Delete Task**: Remove tasks from your list by specifying their number.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in a `tasks.json` file, so your data is preserved between sessions.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your local machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**

   If you have Git installed, you can clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   Alternatively, download the script directly from the repository's page.

2. **Navigate to the Script Directory**

   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/script
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**

   Execute the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python task_tracker.py
   ```

2. **Interact with the CLI**

   - **Add Task**: Choose option `1` and enter the task name and due date when prompted.
   - **List Tasks**: Choose option `2` to display all your tasks and their due dates.
   - **Delete Task**: Choose option `3`, then enter the number of the task you wish to delete.
   - **Exit**: Choose option `4` to exit the application.

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how the CLI interaction might look:
